    <h1>SYLVIA ASHKENAZIE</h1>
    <p>Hi, welcome! I am 17 years old and am a rising senior at the Yeshivah of Flatbush Joel Braverman High School in Brooklyn, New York. I am the oldest out of four girls, and am way too obsessed with Grey's Anatomy. I love ice cream with fruit and am allergic to peanuts, cashews and pistachios, which is unfortunate, because my mother's side of the family reigns from Lebanon and many Lebanese desserts include these nuts. Cooking and baking are one of my favorite pastimes, along with reading anything from fiction to non-fiction.</p>
